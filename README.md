# hello_world

They told me you had been to her,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mentioned me to him:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gave me a good character,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But said I could not swim.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;He sent them word I had not gone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(We know it to be true):<br />
&nbsp;If she should push the matter on,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would become of you?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I gave her one, they gave him two,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;You gave us three or more;<br />
They all returned from him to you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though they were mine before.
